## Prerequisites 

- PostgresSQL
- Postico (SQL editor)
- Node
- Express 

## Database Setup

You'll also need a database. 

The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries. 

## Installation

1. To install, click the green `code` button at the top this page. Fork and clone this repo.

2. Open the project in a code editor of your choice and run the following command `npm install` in the terminal. 

3. Create a database named `weekend_to_do_app`

4. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly.

5. Run `npm start` in your terminal.

6. Then, open your browser and visit http://localhost:5000/

## Usage 

1. Fill in a task name and task note.

2. Click, `Add Task` and the task will be listed under Task List.

3. Once a task has been completed, click the `Incomplete` button. This will change to `Complete` and cross out the completed task.

4. If you no longer need the task in your list, click the `Delete` button and this will remove the task from your list.
